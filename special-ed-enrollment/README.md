Dataset: There is no direct dataset associated withit. I referred to (https://data1.cde.ca.gov/dataquest/), extracted special education enrollment data only for SantaClara county (in CA)
for every year and copy pasted the result to a separate excel sheet (which was a bit tedious because we are only able to download this in pdf form)

App demonstrates the use of: Data cleaning, Shiny inputs and output atm

Deployed at https://testing-apps.shinyapps.io/special-ed-enrollment-county/
